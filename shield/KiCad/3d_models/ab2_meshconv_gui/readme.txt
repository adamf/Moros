The program output files are hardcoded to my file naming conventions
The program expects an input file with _OPENSCAD postfix
The program will append a _WINGS3D postfix to the output file

File naming convention
  INPUT FILE:
    filename_OPENSCAD.stl
  OUTPUT FILE:
    filename_WINGS3D.stl
    
So unless you modify the program I highly recommend adding the _OPENSCAD postfix...
as I felt my time was better spent annoying anyone who uses the program with a quality exit dialogue...

You're welcome :)

This has been an Alan Bullick original 2 minute readme...hopefully it helps
